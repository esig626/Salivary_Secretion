Investigation of Primary Saliva Secretion in Salivary Gland Acinar Cells
Salivary gland acinar cells use calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) ions as signaling messengers to regulate a diverse range of intracellular processes, including the secretion of primary saliva. Although the underlying mechanisms responsible for saliva secretion are reasonably well understood, the precise role played by spatially heterogeneous intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in these cells remains uncertain.

Overview
In this study, we use a mathematical model based on new and unpublished experimental data from parotid acinar cells (measured in excised lobules of mouse parotid gland) to investigate how the structure of the cell and the spatio-temporal properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling influence the production of primary saliva. We combine a new Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling model (described in detail in a companion paper: Pages et al. (2018), submitted) with an existing secretion model (Vera-Sig√ºenza E, et al., Bull Math Biol 80: 255-282, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-017-0370-6) and solve the resultant model in an anatomically-accurate three-dimensional cell.

Key Findings
Our study yields three principal results:

Spatial Heterogeneities of Ca<sup>2+</sup> Concentration:

We show that spatial heterogeneities of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in either the apical or basal regions of the cell have no significant effect on the rate of primary saliva secretion.
Frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> Oscillation:

In agreement with previous work (Palk L., et al., 2012, J. Theor. Biol. 305:45-53, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.04.009), we show that the frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation has no significant effect on the rate of primary saliva secretion, which is determined almost entirely by the mean (over time) of the apical and basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>].
Quasi-Steady State Model:

It is possible to model the rate of primary saliva secretion as a quasi-steady state function of the cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] averaged over the entire cell when modeling the flow rate is the only interest. This approach ignores all the dynamic complexity not only of the fluid secretion mechanism but also of the intracellular heterogeneity of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>.
Conclusion
Taken together, our results demonstrate that an accurate multiscale model of primary saliva secretion from a single acinar cell can be constructed by ignoring the vast majority of the spatial and temporal complexity of the underlying mechanisms.
